## Release Notes
### Version 0.1.0
(first working version)
* This program is under heavy development.
* Please download "use.this.one.instead" archive below, as aspects of this release had to be backdated to 2017-09-28 to provide a working version (and see backdated README.md in there too for accuracy).
  * differs from "source code" or other downloads below generated by GitHub, which should not be used 
  * includes special patches to the forms, in order to provide a complete version that does not yet have the newest (WIP) javascript code (which would generate forms at load time based on section objects)
* This version has some security issues that those in the know can recognize easily. Besides those, here are some specific ones you should know: Make sure you change the pins in config.js.example before saving it as config.js; never upload it to the internet once changed to your private pins that only your organization should know; storing pins (as they are passwords) as plain text is prohibited by some organizational policies and this and other security problems with integratoredu are planned to be rectified eventually.
* Prefill is broken in this version (when form is not validated, it will be cleared) due to transition from very bad global prefill method to user-based to session (request) -based still being a WIP.
