To use the API of the system written by Arneson
 use the following in your route section of your page to protect a section only visible via sign-in:

```
// Simple route middleware to ensure user is authenticated.
function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) { return next(); }
  req.session.error = 'Please sign in!';
  res.redirect('/signin');
}
```

The above only applies to the 2nd commit (next commit after initial commit).
Also, sign in was changed to login everywhere to differentiate between that and signing people in and out of the building in real life.

## General Node.js info:
* Templates can have comments that will not appear in the output html:
	```{{!--<strong>Hi,</strong>--}}```
